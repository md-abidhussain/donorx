# 🩸 DonorX

DonorX is a community-driven blood donor connector built as a hackathon prototype for **Technozova 6.0**.

The platform helps people quickly post blood requirements and allows nearby donors to browse urgent requests.  
To reduce fake or outdated posts, DonorX uses **request expiry** and **rule-based verification logic**.
